1. Dependencies: The files share dependencies such as Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. These are specified in the "package.json" file.

2. Exported Variables: The "_app.tsx" and "index.tsx" files may export components that could be used in other parts of the application.

3. Data Schemas: There are no specific data schemas mentioned in the prompt, but if there were, they would likely be shared across multiple files.

4. ID Names: The ID names for the DOM elements in the marquee components ("MarqueeTop.tsx" and "MarqueeBottom.tsx") would be shared with any JavaScript functions that interact with these elements.

5. Message Names: There are no specific message names mentioned in the prompt, but if there were, they would likely be shared across multiple files.

6. Function Names: Functions defined in one file may be used in another. For example, a function to animate the marquees could be defined in "MarqueeTop.tsx" and used in "MarqueeBottom.tsx".

7. CSS Classes: The "globals.css" file would contain CSS classes that are used across multiple components. These classes would be shared across the application.

8. Tailwind Configuration: The "tailwind.config.js" file would contain configuration for Tailwind CSS that is used across the application.

9. PostCSS Configuration: The "postcss.config.js" file would contain configuration for PostCSS that is used across the application.
